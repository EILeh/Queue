Queue

Program has a cycle that tells how many cars can go through the green light
untill it turns red. If traffic light is red cars can be added in the queue
to wait for their turn. Cars can be removed from the queue only by turning
the light green. Traffic light colours can be changed from green to red or
red to green. Yellow isn't added because it does nothing. If light's colour
turns to green from red the cycle's amount of cars can go trough and then the
light turns back to red. Program prints the register numbers of the cars that
got through the green light. Program also prints the register numbers of the
cars that are waiting in the red light or if the line is empty, program
informs that. If the light is green and car is added, the car can go
immediately through the light.
